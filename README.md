# Control-Systems-Final-Notes-ELG-3155
Easily accessible and easily searchable notes made in LaTeX that cut out the usual fluff of textbook nonsense while fixing the incompleteness of lecture notes, with plenty of examples for your convenience. The examples should be similar to the ones your would find on a test. Hopefully a completed (albeit rough) draft will be completed by Apr 8th, 2024. The rough draft may not be the most organized in terms of material, but it will be a solid survival guide for the course. Please feel free to submit an issue if you find an error. If you wish to rectify the error yourself, please send a pull request and I will verify it, and the change will be made.
